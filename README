JAVASCRIPT CLICK TRACKING LIBRARY
By Erik Vold ( http://erikvold.com/ )



PURPOSE:
To help web publishers easily track link clicks the correct way, across browser platforms, with tools GA and GWO.

Typically a web publisher will want to do something like track all external links on a website with GA, or setup a
GWO test where the conversion is a click through. This javascript library was designed to make tasks such as these
simple.



ABOUT:
- clickTrackingLib:
Adding the click-tracking-lib.js or the click-tracking-lib-with-presets.js to a web page provides you with a
clickTrackingLib javascript object. Once you provide clickTrackingLib with some match objects, you can then
have clickTrackingLib scan a single, set, or all document links to determine if the link(s) should have
tracking functions applied to it or not, and do so if needed. If one or more tracking functions are applied to
a link, then a delay function will be applied to the link (this can be disabled too of course, and the delay can
user defined but the default is 99 ms).


- Presets:
There are a number of presets available if you use click-tracking-lib-with-presets.js or click-tracking-presets.js;
presets are predefined match functions for common use cases, such as matching all internal links, or external links,
or document links. They can be used as they written, you could cut out the ones you won't use, or simply use them as
examples when you define your own custom match objects.

The can be accessed from the clickTrackingLib.getMatchPreset( name ) method. The possible name values and the meanings
behind them are as follows:
- 'rel-external': matches rel-external links
- 'external-hostname': matches external hostname links
- 'all-external': matches all rel-external and external hostname links
- 'filetypes': matches file names
- 'non-rel-external': matches non-rel-external links
- 'internal-hostname': matches internal hostname links
- 'all-internal': matches non-rel-external links or internal hostname links


- Match Object
Any object that has a 'match(link):boolean' method and 'trackingFunc(e,link):void' method defined.


- new clickTrackingLib._clickTrackingLib();

If you want to create multiple clickTrackingLib objects, that contain different sets of match object arrays, then
you need to create a new one, like so:

var myNewClickTrackingObj = new clickTrackingLib._clickTrackingLib();

This will give you a new object, myNewClickTrackingObj, which is like clickTrackingLib in all but two ways. First
myNewClickTrackingObj will not have a _clickTrackingLib() method, and second it will not have a getMatchPreset()
method, even if clickTrackingLib.getMatchPreset() was defined. This is because you don't need a bunch of objects
in memory with those two methods, only one, which is the singleton clickTrackingLib object.



HOW TO USE:
- Download either click-tracking-lib-with-presets.js or click-tracking-lib.js (see ABOUT fore more information)
- Minify it with one of the following options:
-- YUICompressor: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
-- Dojo ShrinkSafe: http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/shrinksafe
-- Packer: http://dean.edwards.name/packer/
-- JSMin: http://crockford.com/javascript/jsmin
-- Google's Closure: http://code.google.com/intl/pl/closure/compiler/
- Upload the minified script to your site
- Add <script src=".." type="text/javascript"></script> for the script to the desired pages
- Write some code:
-- define some match objects (just an object with a match method and trackingFunc method)
-- Add match objects to your clickTrackingLib object
-- Call the clickTrackingLib.attachTrackingFunctions( links, delay ) when desired.
--- links: can be a single anchor element, an array of anchor elements, or falsely so that
           the default is used, which is document.links.
--- delay: should be a positive integer or falsey, in the latter case no delay function will be added to the
           links scanned, in the former case a delay function will be applied with the specified delay value.



EXAMPLE:
<script src="../click-tracking-lib.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="../click-tracking-presets.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script>
	var test = new clickTrackingLib._clickTrackingLib();
	var matchAry = [
		{
			match: clickTrackingLib.getMatchPreset( "all-external" ),
			trackingFunc: function(){
				alert("external");
			}
		},
		{
			match: function(link){
				return (link.className.match(/download/i)) ? true : false;
			},
			trackingFunc: function(e, link){
				alert("download");
			}
		},
		{
			match: clickTrackingLib.getMatchPreset( "all-internal" ),
			trackingFunc: function(e, link){
				alert("internal");
			}
		}
	];
	test.addMatches( matchAry );
	test.attachTrackingFunctions(null,50);

	var newA = document.createElement("a");
	newA.href="http://erikvold.com/";
	document.body.appendChild(newA);
	newA.innerHTML = "ErikVold.com";

	test.attachTrackingFunctions( newA );
</script>
